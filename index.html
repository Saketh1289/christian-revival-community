                <p>AG Revival Worship Centre in Nangal Dam, Punjab stands as a testament to the divine calling bestowed upon its founder,
                     Rev. K. Christudas. Originating from Kerala, he arrived in the heart of Punjab with a profound vision from God to evangelize
                      the rural landscapes of the region. Having diligently completed his theological studies at esteemed institutions such as Bethel 
                      College in Punalur, Kerala, Bethany College in Trivandrum, Kerala, and COTR Theological College in Vishakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh,
                       Rev. Christudas embarked on his mission in Nangal Dam on October 13, 1998. <br>
                    Initiating his journey with a humble fellowship in a rented room, he steadfastly prayed and fasted,
                     seeking divine guidance for the unfolding gospel ministry in this small town situated on the border
                      of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. Throughout the challenging initial phase, numerous servants of God stood in solidarity,
                       offering unwavering support through fervent prayer. <br>
                    
                    Through persistent prayer, fasting, and the dedicated work of God, the church has blossomed 
                    from having zero believers in Nangal Dam to a thriving congregation of 300 and counting. Presently, Rev. Christudas, alongside his wife and two daughters,
                     ministers to the spiritual needs of this town. Guided by divine inspiration, he has extended his outreach by establishing new fellowships in various villages spanning Himachal and Punjab. <br>
                    
                    The visionary pursuit, inspired by a divine calling, envisions the church becoming a beacon for
                     local residents, empowering indigenous leaders for evangelism. This divine calling extends to the evangelization of villages yet 
                     untouched by the gospel message. Furthermore, the mission seeks to minister to the specific needs of children, youth, and those grappling with drug and alcohol addiction,
                      embodying a holistic approach to spiritual outreach.
